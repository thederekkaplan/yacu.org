		<h1>About the YACU</h1>
		<p>The Young Americans Coalition for Unity (YACU) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging youth in politics and promoting unity and bipartisanship. As the US's only youth-led nonpartisan & bipartisan organization focused on this unique combined mission of youth and unity, the YACU seeks to give everyone -- no matter their party, ideology, or background -- a chance to share their political beliefs, get involved, and find common ground. We're hosting special events, creating a nationwide network of local chapters, and fostering bipartisan discussions daily.</p>
		<p>At the YACU, you can volunteer, lead, make new friends, and pursue opportunities only our coalition can provide. Whatever you believe, wherever you are, and why ever you're here: the YACU welcomes you.</p>
