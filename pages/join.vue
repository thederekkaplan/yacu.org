  	<p>The Young Americans Coalition for Unity is proud to be connected with a variety of politicians, organizations, and academics to offer our members opportunities in many different fields. Our connections with these three groups are facilitated by the outreach subdivision of the political team. If you would like to be connected with a politician, organization, or academic that is not listed on our database, please use <a href="https://airtable.com/embed/shrGO0v2W2B6SCRrK">this form</a> to request that our team contact them. These databases are updated regularly.</p>

    		<p style="font-size: 14px;">Our Partners in Youth Engagement (PYEs) are youth-focused organizations that can be partisan or nonpartisan. We often collaborate with PYEs to share programming between other young people and to help engage a wider span of young people in politics.</p><br>

    		<p style="font-size: 14px;">Our Partners in Unity and Bipartisanship (PUBs) are organizations that are focused on bringing bipartisanship into politics today. We often work with PUBs to help educate members on important policy issues from both sides of the aisle as well as provide opportunities to expand civil political discussion.</p><br>

    		<p style="font-size: 14px;">As a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) organization, the YACU does not endorse, promote, nor support any of the politicians or candidates listed on our database. During a campaign season, we have listings of volunteer and/or internship opportunities for high school and college students. We also have these candidates present at campaign spotlights during our YACU-Cons. After the election, we have listings of internship opportunities at congressional offices and other offices of elected officials.</p><br>
